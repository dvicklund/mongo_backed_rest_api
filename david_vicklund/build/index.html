  <h1>Food Metanalysisomerator</h1>
  <h3>Not sure what metanalysisomeration is?</h3>
  <p>You're not alone.  Thousands of people around the world don't know about the sheer computational power required to build a metanalysisomerating machine, much less wield one with any hope of survival.</p>
  <p>Fortunately for you, we here at MEAL-Tec have engineered a purely elegant solution in the form of this very app!  That's right, for the low-low price of absolutely nothing at all, you can have the power of metanalysisomeration in your hands <strong>RIGHT NOW!</strong></p>
